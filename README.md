I'm very interested in software development and building functional applications for everyday users. I've recently graduated from Coding Dojo where I learned 3 full stack technologies: Python/Flask/MySQL, MERN and Java/Spring. 


I have a lot of experience with HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, SpringBoot, NextJs and Apache Maven. 

On the database side, I am familiar with MongoDB and MySQL currently working with Postgres.

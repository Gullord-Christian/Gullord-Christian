Iâ€™m very interested in programming and learning new languages. I've recently graduated from Coding Dojo where I was able to learn 3 full stack technologies, Python/Flask/MySQL, MERN and Java/Spring. 


I also have quite a bit of experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Spring, Maven, Flask. On the database side, I am familiar with MongoDB and MySQL.
